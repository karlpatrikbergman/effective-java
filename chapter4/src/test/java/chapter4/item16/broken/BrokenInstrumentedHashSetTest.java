     * We expect getAddCount() to return 3, but it returns 6!
     * The reason for this is that HashSets addAll() is implemented on top of it's add()
     *
     * The addAll method in InstrumentedHash-Set added three to addCount and then invoked HashSetâ€™s addAll
     * implementation using super.addAll. This in turn invoked the add method, as overridden in InstrumentedHashSet,
     * once for each element. Each of these three invocations added one more to addCount, for a total increase of six:
     * each element added with the addAll method is double-counted.
